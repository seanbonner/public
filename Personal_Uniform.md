I'm an advocate of a personal uniform and originally documented my thoughts on this in a blog post in 2010
[ http://blog.seanbonner.com/2010/08/26/personal-uniforms/ ] 

Since then my thoughts and the specifics have evolved and I thought it would be good to track those changes here.

As of June 2019 my policy is this:

1. Black/Dark Grey only
2. No blatant branding
3. No impulse buys, research everything ahead of time.
4. Travel friendly (light, compact, packable)
5. Outter wear Multi season friendly (layers vs single purpose)
6. Under wear season sepecific

I blogged more details on these specifics

I'll expand on this with specific choices soon.
