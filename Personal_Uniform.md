I'm an advocate of a personal uniform and originally documented my thoughts on this in a blog post in 2010
[ http://blog.seanbonner.com/2010/08/26/personal-uniforms/ ] 

Since then my thoughts and the specifics have evolved and I thought it would be good to track those changes here.

As of December 2015 my policy is this:

1. Black only
2. No blatant branding
3. No impulse buys, research everything ahead of time.
4. Travel friendly (light, compact, packable)
5. Multi season friendly (layers vs single purpose)

I'll expand on this with specific choices soon.
