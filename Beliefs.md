My beliefs
==========

THIS IS STILL BEING EDITED, MUCH IS COPYPASTA FROM ORIGINAL - NOT FINAL. ADD ISSUES AS NEEDED.

On Morality (internal)
----------------------
* All life is valuable
* It's possible to love everyone, but not very practical. 
* It's perfectly OK to dislike some people, but better to just not care about them.
* Hate requires a lot of effort that isn't worth spending on people who ask for it.
* It's important to recognize that everyone is important to someone
* But that doesn't mean they should be important to you.
* It's easy to assume people share your morals, most don't
* Humans are destructive by nature
* People should be judged by their actions, not their words
* People should be judged by their actions, not their gender, color, religion, etc...
* Assume good faith. Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.

On Ethics (external)
--------------------
* Gay marriage should be legal everywhere
* Abortion should be legal everywhere
* Assisted suicide should be legal everywhere
* Health care should be available to everyone who needs it
* The death penalty should be used in extreme and certain cases to protect the public
* Prisons should be about protecting the public, not about punishment
* Recreational drugs should be legal and taxed
* Owning a gun should be legal but require certification from a firearms officer verifying that they've taken a safety course, are free of violent criminal record, and have passed a psychological mental health check.
 

On Spirituality
---------------
* There is no God
* Remember, we will die
* Souls don't exist
* Intention can't create reality, but can change our perception of it
* There is no such thing as a miracle
* There is no heaven/hell
* We don't have a purpose given to us, but we can make one up


On Science & The Universe
-------------------------
* Other dimensions and universes exist
* Micro and macro evolution happens
* Something like the Big Bang happened
* Something existed before the Big Bang (outside of time and space as we know them)
* The human brain (in its current state of evolution) can't comprehend the universe
* We have no cosmic significance
* Aliens exist
* Non-carbon-based life forms exist
* Space travel throughout the universe is probably entirely the domain of robots and cyborgs
* Forwards time-travel is possible, but backwards is not
* Chances are, we live in a simulation


On Health
---------
* We can change our behavior and habits (it requires a lot of energy)
* Consistently eating well and exercising is the only way to be sustainably healthy
* Vaccinations are good for society, but shouldn't be devised or regulated by profit focused industries


On Technology
-------------
* Computers will be building better computers than humans by 2050 (the Singularity)
* Humans, computers, and Earth will evolve into a super organism by 2200 (if we're still around)
* Humans that embrace change (and give up some of their humanity) will survive the Singularity
* Technology will eventually disrupt all other human-created institutions (politics, religion, identity, economics)


On The Self
-----------
* Free will is mostly an illusion (but does exist in limited form)
* Pure altruism is an illusion (but kindness is not)
* We tell stories in order to create and remember meaning
* Consciousness is the result of a feedback loop between our story-making cortex and our subconscious (ain't it nice though?)
* Privacy is a human right
* Giving up our privacy and individuality in exchange for better connection will be the norm by 2050


On Education
------------
* Most schools in the US are bloated and behind the times.
* Most schools focus on teaching people to follow orders rather than embrace learning


On Politics & The Economy
-------------------------
* Most jobs lost in 2008-present aren't going to come back, new ones have to be created from scratch
* In the future, working will be more thoroughly decoupled from having the means to live
* Power will be more quickly redistributed when it gets too heavy at the top


On The Future Of Earth (2100)
-----------------------------
* Global warming is real and will continue to cause big problems
* There will be 10 billion people
* 80% of people will live in cities and new mega-cities by 2100
* The number of living languages in the world will drop to under 100
* Genetically modified foods will become the norm
* Coral reefs and the ocean ecosystems are going to break with unknown consequences
* Solar and wind will slowly replace gas and oil 

On Biases
---------
* We tend to favor the beautiful
* We tend to see what we expect to see
* We tend to attribute too much credit to success (and under-credit luck)

On Love
-------
* Love is not binary or singular
* It's possible to love many people in different ways
* Love and hate are very similar, different points on one spectrum.

Joi's Principals
----------------
* Resilience over strength, which means you want to yield and allow failure and you bounce back instead of trying to resist failure.
* Pull over push. That means you pull the resources from the network as you need them, as opposed to centrally stocking them and controlling them.
* Risk over safety.
* Systems over objects.
* Compasses over maps. Knowing how to find your way is more important than knowing a way exists.
* Practice over theory. Because sometimes you don’t know why it works, but what is important is that it is working, not that you have some theory around it.
* Disobedience over compliance. You don’t get a Nobel Prize for doing what you are told.
* Emergency over authority. The crowd instead of experts.
* Learning over education. Education is what others do to you, learning is what you do for yourself.


Meta
----
* We have very little control over what we believe in
* Some of my beliefs will be proven wrong
* I'm willing to be convinced that my beliefs are wrong
* Making and maintaining this list is useful and fun (you should do it too)
